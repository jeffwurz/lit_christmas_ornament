There are a few modes, the default option (ALL OF THEM) is to have all the modes play after each-other. But if you would like to select just one that you like, there is a dropdown where you can select just one. Since these are controlled by a mcp23017, there are essentially 16 LED outputs, in the form of 2 bytes (8 bits), there are many ways to set a pattern.
